# Important Dates SMS Reminder

This is a serverless application using Amazon Web Services (AWS).  A time-based CloudWatch event triggers the Lambda Function to run once a day.  On the first day of every month an SMS is sent with all important dates for the month; a daily SMS is sent for any important events on that date.

Whether you have any knowledge of AWS or coding, this documentation written with the intention to provide everything you need to implement this application.
